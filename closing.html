    <p>Service sunset as of ___.</p>
    <p>
      After ___ years of trying my best, this messages represents the end. I've chosen it for myself. I've brought and
      shared joy here, and that is enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't want to explain why. I hope it can be understood without an explanation. I just want there to be peace and
      beauty moving on.
